# why qwerty? not colemak?

I used colemak for few months and recognized that qwerty can be better.
Of Course colemak is easier to use and comfortable to type. But there's a Problem with
colemak. 

1. It doesn't fit to Vim.
2. It is too hard to use it for every single shortcuts and in Smartphones.
3. I almost forgot how to use qwerty.
4. Other person can't use my Keyboard.

## Keymapping

I know also that, i can use Keymapping in Vim. However it is too hard. For example Vim use 2 Philosophy for their program. First "for Hands", Seconds "For Meaning". So hjkl keys are for Hands, i(insert) y(yank) are for Meaning. In this point Users must change their keys into other Keys. Most Colemak users change insert keys to "k", which i think not sexy.

If you use Web-browser with vimimum, than you should also change your keys exactly like your changed vim mapping. It sucks. 

Imagine you buy new server or Computer. After that you can use vim in linux or something. In this case, colemak users must set the keys again! I hate it. My motto for Keymapping is"simple and minimal". 

Left-hand user adapt their self to hjkl keys , not asdf. Because It is Basic Keys for vim.
